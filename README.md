# CIS122-Project
Notes:

*Unity*
Remember when adding things to the hieracrchy (Including messing with componets) you are doing so just to that scene.
Use Prefabs if possible!
We will use "SampleScene" for general testing, and "Level 1" for offical design that we present.

*Github*
When you are working on something it is best to commit and push to your branch regualary!
It is best when you are done working the day to merge your changes to main so the rest of us can use your work
If you have a branch that was made before a push to main, you can go to pull requests and pull the changes from main into your branch
If there is ever conflicts please let the group look at the conflicts.
